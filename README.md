# Dragquify

A drag and drop code generator for schema tags in Shopify's
section architecture. Can also be used to prototype the output
in Shopify's theme editor and test merchant experience.

I built this to learn Liquid and to understand theme sections
to visualize how input settings
appear in the theme editor.

Made before Shopify's Theme 2.0 update.
